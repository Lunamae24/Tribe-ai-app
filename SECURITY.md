Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Report Privately

Send details to: [Add your security contact email]

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use secure secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **API Keys**
   - Store in environment variables
   - Restrict API key permissions
   - Monitor API usage
   - Rotate keys quarterly

3. **Database**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable SSL/TLS connections
   - Restrict network access
   - Regular backups

4. **HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher
   - Keep SSL certificates up to date

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configure appropriate rate limits
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Implement IP blocking for repeated violations

### For Development

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run security audits: `pip-audit`
   - Review dependency changes

2. **Code Review**
   - Review all code changes
   - Use security linters
   - Follow secure coding practices

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests
   - Test authentication/authorization
   - Test input validation
