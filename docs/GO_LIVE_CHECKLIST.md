## Emergency Procedures

### If Things Go Wrong

1. **Assess the Situation**
   - Check health endpoints
   - Review error logs
   - Check monitoring dashboards

2. **Communicate**
   - Notify team immediately
   - Update status page
   - Inform stakeholders

3. **Quick Fixes**
   - Try restart if appropriate
   - Roll back if necessary
   - Apply hotfix if available

4. **Rollback Decision Tree**
   - Critical bug affecting users? → Rollback
   - Performance degradation? → Scale up or rollback
   - Minor issue with workaround? → Monitor and fix

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Document what happened
   - Conduct post-mortem
   - Implement preventive measures
